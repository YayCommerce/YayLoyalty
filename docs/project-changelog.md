## Unreleased

### Added — F09 Customer Drawer, Wave A

A full-screen/panel drawer (`#/customers/:userId`) opened from a Customers-list row, built UI-first
against a `WP_DEBUG`-gated PHP fixture (six named scenarios) so every state — new/zero, large
figures, deleted, expiring, negative balance — could be reviewed before the real data path had to
carry all of them. The default (no `?scenario=`) request always serves the real repository, so the
drawer already agrees with the real Customers list; swapping any remaining fixture-only surface to
real data is a controller-only change, never an SPA change (every fixture scenario parses through
the same Zod schema as the real path).

**Shipped:**
- Six-stat header (Balance, Pending, Expires, Lifetime earned, Lifetime redeemed, Worth) on an
  `auto-fit`/`minmax(150px,1fr)` grid; figures are never abbreviated.
- Actions row: Adjust points (live — reuses the existing bulk-adjust dialog/mutation/invalidation);
  Reset expiry / Export ledger / Assign tier (Pro) are visible but permanently disabled in Wave A,
  each with a stated reason — no endpoint yet.
- Four-tab bar with live counts. Points ledger: paged (10/page, never "Load more"), type filter
  with per-type counts, date range, search over description/order number, running balance column.
  Activity log / Redemptions / Referrals render a distinct, named empty state only — their backing
  tables do not exist yet (see `data-model.md`'s new "Activity log (not designed)" section).
- Deleted-account and negative-balance treatments (disabled actions with reasons; a tinted, never
  red, warning marker — matching the existing Customers-list convention).
- `useDebouncedSearchCommit` extracted from the Customers list's own search box into a shared hook
  (`apps/admin/src/hooks/`), now used by both the list and the drawer's ledger search — a
  behavior-preserving refactor, not a rewrite.

**Recorded, not built (Wave B):** real ledger filters and real per-type counts (`type_counts` is
`null` on the real path — deliberately not bundled, they are different costs at scale); Export
ledger as a background job; the `customers.deleted_at` column + soft-delete write path (wire field
exists, no column yet); the Activity log table itself (unpriced — the largest gap this wave
surfaces).

See `docs/data-model.md` (Activity log gap, `deleted_at`), `docs/codebase-summary.md` (drawer route,
fixture location) for the reference-doc detail, and `plans/260917-1504-customer-drawer-wave-a/`
for the full plan and phase-by-phase implementation notes.
